## Build instructions

### Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone ssh://git@bitbucket.sw.nxp.com/mag/smart-kitchen.git
```

### Update modules:

```bash
cd smart-kitchen/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Set the environment

This example is using linux 5.15-kirkstone for i.MX8M Mini

```bash
source /opt/fsl-imx-internal-xwayland/5.15-kirkstone/environment-setup-cortexa53-crypto-poky-linux
```

### Build

Inside smart-kitchen demo execute make

```bash
cd smart-kitchen/
make
```

Then move to VIT directory and execute make

```bash
cd smart-kitchen/imxvoiceui/vit/i.MX8M_A53/
make
```

### Download binary files to board

Copy next files to board:

- `smart-kitchen/imxvoiceui/vit/i.MX8M_A53/build/vit_demo`
- `smart-kitchen/demo`
- `smart-kitchen/run.sh`

## How to run

Once the files are copied, simply make sure the three files are all in the same location, and execute run.sh file:

```bash
./run.sh
```
